# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) with Librosa
Objective: This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model to classify emotions from speech signals, an essential task in natural language processing and human-computer interaction.

# Methodology:

Feature Extraction: Utilized the Librosa library for extracting relevant acoustic features from audio signals, focusing on characteristics that reflect emotional nuances in speech.

Model Training: Trained a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier on the extracted features to learn patterns associated with different emotions.

Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, and Recall were measured for each emotion category to assess model performance.

Results: The SER model demonstrated promising accuracy and achieved satisfactory precision and recall across different emotion categories, highlighting the effectiveness of the Librosa-based feature extraction approach.

Technologies Used: Librosa for feature extraction, MLP classifier for emotion prediction, and standard evaluation metrics for performance analysis.
